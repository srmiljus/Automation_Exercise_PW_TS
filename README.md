Playwright Automation Test Suite

This repository contains end-to-end automated tests written in Playwright with TypeScript.

The suite validates core user-facing functionality of the Automation Exercise website, including:
	•	User registration and login
	•	Negative validation messages (e.g., wrong credentials, duplicate email)
	•	Adding products to the cart
	•	Cart detail verification (name, price, quantity)
	•	Modal visibility and link navigation
	•	Tag-based test grouping: @regression, @negative, @smoke

Target website: https://automationexercise.com

The project follows a clean Page Object Model (POM) structure with reusable methods, custom locators, and fixtures using base.fixture.ts.

## Deliverables

* A complete Playwright test automation framework
* Page Object Model (POM) structure with reusable methods and locators
* Tag-based test grouping for flexible test execution
* GitHub Actions CI integration
* HTML test report generated after each run

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srmiljus/Automation_Exercise_PW_TS.git
cd Automation_Exercise_PW_TS
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### 3. Install Playwright browsers

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### 4. (Optional) Set environment variables via .env file

You can override default settings like BASE_URL by creating a .env file in the project root:

```env
BASE_URL=https://www.automationexercise.com
```

> GitHub Actions automatically copies `.env` to `.env.local` during test execution.

## Test Execution Instructions

### Run all tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run tests by tag

```bash
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
npx playwright test --grep @regression
npx playwright test --grep @negative
npx playwright test --grep @e2e

```

### Run tests by browser

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit


### Show HTML report locally

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Approach Explanation

* Uses a clean Page Object Model (POM) structure
* Uses fixtures to inject Page Object classes
* Allure reporter for rich test results
* Tags used to organize tests: `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@negative`
* API validations included for signup and cleanup
* Verifies expected error messages and URL transitions
* Supports both functional and UI-level validation

---

## Assumptions & Limitations

* Tests are executed on Chromium, Firefox and Webkit in CI
* Mobile/responsive testing is not included
* Allure reports are uploaded as CI artifacts, not viewable via GitHub Pages
* API stubbing is not used; tests rely on real responses

---

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow:

* Runs on every push or PR to `main` or `master`
* Supports manual triggering with dropdowns for:
  - Test tag selection (`@smoke`, `@regression`, `@negative`, `all`)
  - Browser selection (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`, `all`)
* Generates and uploads Allure and HTML reports as artifacts

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`

---

## Test Report

Test results are stored as artifacts in GitHub Actions:

* **Allure Report**: Generated via Allure CLI and stored in `allure-report/`
* **Playwright HTML Report**: Stored in `reports/`

To view reports locally:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

To view Allure report locally:

```bash
npx allure serve allure-results
```

## Tech Stack

* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - v1.52+
* TypeScript - v5.8+
* Node.js - v20+
* GitHub Actions - CI/CD integration
* HTML Reporting - Playwright HTML & Allure
